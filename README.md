# Animal Competition System üêæ

Welcome to the Animal Competition System! This Java-based application simulates dynamic animal competitions using a sophisticated multi-threading architecture.

## Overview

The Animal Competition System brings animal competitions to life through advanced thread management. Each animal and competition operates independently, creating a truly parallel and realistic simulation.

## Key Features

- **Thread-Per-Entity Design**: Every animal and competition runs in its own thread.
- **Dynamic Animal Behaviors**: Diverse animals with unique attributes, each operating autonomously.
- **Concurrent Competitions**: Multiple competitions can run simultaneously, each in its own thread.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Experience live updates across all active threads.
- **Results Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of outcomes from multiple concurrent threads.

## Threading Architecture

Our system leverages threads in two key ways:

1. **Animal Threads**: Each animal operates in its own thread, making independent decisions and actions.
2. **Competition Threads**: Every competition runs in a separate thread, managing its specific events and participants.

This dual-threaded approach allows for:
- True parallelism in animal behaviors and competition progression
- Realistic simulation of multiple, simultaneous events
- Scalability to handle numerous animals and competitions without performance degradation

## How It Works

1. **Add Animals**: Start by adding various animals into the system. Each animal comes with its own set of attributes and behaviors.

2. **Configure Competitions**: Set up the competition by choosing the environment (water, air, or terrestrial) and the competition type (regular or courier).

3. **Run Competitions**: Launch the competition and observe as each animal and event operates independently.
4. **View Results**: check out the detailed results, including finish times and rankings.
